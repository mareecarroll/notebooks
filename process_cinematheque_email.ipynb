Both filmmakers emerged as key figures in the 1960s, each betraying and confirming their strong affinity with the history of cinema and other art forms. This program profiles two of their less widely seen but central works from this seminal period, opening with Bertolucci’s appropriately labyrinthine and mercurial adaptation of a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. Released within months of The Conformist, The Spider’s Stratagem demonstrates both the full range of Bertolucci’s work and his characteristic preoccupation with the legacies of history, place and identity. The exquisite recent restoration of Rivette’s La religieuse profiles an extraordinary central performance by Anna Karina, while also highlighting the Melbourne Cinémathèque’s overriding goal of profiling challenging works of film history in optimal conditions.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday February 5\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"THE SPIDER’S STRATAGEM\" info=\"Bernardo Bertolucci (1970) 100 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"The son of a martyred anti-fascist hero travels to a small Italian village searching for the truth behind his father’s death, only to unravel a web of myths, mysteries and lies. In this intimate, mesmeric film based on a short story by Jorge Luis Borges and exquisitely shot in vibrant shades by Franco Di Giacomo and Vittorio Storaro, Bertolucci’s delicately elusive and deftly non-linear style grapples with themes of historical legacy, cultural inheritance and the intersection of sex, violence and ideology.

Initially condemned by the Catholic church, partly for its critical and honest portrayal of various high officials, Rivette’s characteristically precise, formally adventurous, devastatingly affective and physically palpable portrait of the sad fate of Suzanne Simonin (in an extraordinary incarnation by Anna Karina) is also “one of the greatest prison movies ever made” (Justin Chang).\">]>, <Season dates=\"February 12-26\" start=\"2020-02-12 18:30:00+11:00\" end=\"2020-02-26 22:07:00+11:00\" title=\"VITTORIO DE SICA: CINEMA, ITALIAN STYLE\" desc=\"Vittorio De Sica (1902-1974) will forever be associated with neorealism, the movement he consolidated with a string of influential masterpieces detailing the hardships of working-class life immediately after the Second World War. Yet the actor and director, across a career spanning six decades, ranged widely in his stylistic approaches and concerns. He explored Commedia all’italiana and fabulist fantasy, and made socially incisive romantic comedies and frothy sex comedies. He also worked in Los Angeles as well as Rome and his late work, such as the elegiac triumph The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, successfully combines neorealist principles with Hollywood grandeur and technique. Born in Sora, near Rome, De Sica spent his early years in Naples. His bank-clerk father encouraged his entry into acting and by the 1930s De Sica was a matinee idol, with a debonair screen persona akin to Cary Grant’s. He would continue to act his entire life, often cheerfully taking on lightweight roles to fund his own films, while parlaying his acting talent into a directorial empathy with performers both professional and amateur. It was while acting on a film in 1935 that De Sica met screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, leading to a partnership that defined not only both men’s careers but also the neorealist movement. Of De Sica’s 35 films, Zavattini worked on the scripts of 26, a number of which appear in this season. Working with Zavattini, De Sica would direct four films that would go on to win Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film; in fact, the pair’s work on Shoeshine and Bicycle Thieves received the honorary awards that inaugurated the category. This season presents many of the key works of De Sica’s landmark directorial career including his defining contributions to neorealism and the peak of his iconic collaborations with Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren, Marriage Italian Style.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday February 12\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"BICYCLE THIEVES\" info=\"Vittorio De Sica (1948) 89 mins – PG\" desc=\"A poetic tragicomedy and a landmark of neorealism, De Sica’s most celebrated film follows a man whose bicycle – his livelihood and only salvation in depressed postwar Rome – is taken by a thief, setting off a desperate chase through the war-ravaged city. Filmed on location, this iconic film’s simple construction and unadorned style belie an aching emotional power and richly detailed moral ambiguity. Co-written with Cesare Zavattini, it was voted the greatest film of all time in the inaugural Sight & Sound critics poll and remains a powerful rumination on cycles of oppression.

Its central character, Totò (Francesco Golisano), embodies an angelic perception of the world, passing this onto the impoverished community he belongs to. This “glorious anomaly in De Sica’s career” (Stephen Harvey) is the director’s “most daring” (Michael Atkinson) movie.

Treading a fine line between stark social criticism and an almost hauntingly poetic symbolism, James Agee called it “as beautiful, moving, and heartening a film as you are ever likely to see”. Written by the great Cesare Zavattini and Sergio Amidei, amongst others, it earned an honorary Oscar. 35mm print courtesy of Cinecittà Luce.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday February 26\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"TWO WOMEN\" info=\"Vittorio De Sica (1960) 101 mins – M\" desc=\"Based on Alberto Moravia’s novel, this Cesare Zavattini-scripted tale of survival in war-torn Italy in the early 1940s is one of De Sica’s most celebrated later films.

Beloved for her knack of reinventing herself, Dietrich was a woman who very consciously managed her career and fastidiously cultivated her image. In 1920s Berlin, Dietrich acted on the stage and in silent films, drawing wide appeal for the skills she developed as a chorus girl in vaudeville-style entertainment. Her breakthrough performance as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel in 1930 brought her international acclaim, a contract with Paramount and a collaborative partner, Josef von Sternberg, who would help define her persona across the seven extraordinary features they made together like Dishonored and The Scarlet Empress. Dietrich went on to star in further classic Hollywood films such as Desire, Angel, Destry Rides Again and A Foreign Affair for key directors like Borzage, Lubitsch and Wilder. Although she still made intermittent movies like Wilder’s Witness for the Prosecution, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer, harking back (but always renewed) to the early days of her career. As an icon of popular culture, she remains a powerful signifier in an ever-larger arena of cultural discourses including performativity, gender, ageing, celebrity and sexuality.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday March 4\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"DISHONORED\" info=\"Josef von Sternberg (1931) 91 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"Based on the legendary exploits of Mata Hari, Sternberg’s extravagant reimagining of his native Vienna during World War I is a delirious but grounded mixture of irreverent historicism and romantic melodrama. One of the director’s greatest works, it features a piercingly nonchalant performance but Dietrich as an alluring sex worker and spy who betrays her country for love. This brilliantly designed and costumed (by Travis Banton) espionage tale provides a lucid portrait of a woman forced to use her sexuality in a hostile patriarchal world. Co-stars Victor McLaglen.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday March 4\" time=\"8:15pm\" title=\"DESIRE\" info=\"Frank Borzage (1936) 95 mins – G\" desc=\"Borzage’s elegant, streamlined romantic comedy in the style of Lubitsch (who co-produced) translates the latter’s sophisticated worldliness into a characteristically soulful romanticism. Dietrich stars as the vivacious, cultured jewel thief who cons a naïve automotive engineer (Gary Cooper) into smuggling a necklace from France into Spain, only for love to blossom despite their moral differences. As in many of Dietrich’s greatest performances, costume, décor, gesture and the play of light take starring roles.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday March 11\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"ANGEL\" info=\"Ernst Lubitsch (1937) 91 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"Dietrich plays the disaffected wife of a British diplomat (Herbert Marshall) who flies to Paris for the night to visit the “salon” of a Russian duchess. There she meets and falls for an attractive stranger (Melvyn Douglas) who gives her the codename “Angel”. Regarded as a significant failure on release, it has emerged as one of Lubitsch and Dietrich’s most sophisticated, penetrating and underrated works. An extraordinarily elegant and incisive portrait of the entanglements of love and sexual attraction, it is also a fascinating document of old Europe teetering on the cusp of war.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday March 11\" time=\"8:15pm\" title=\"DESTRY RIDES AGAIN\" info=\"George Marshall (1939) 97 mins – PG\" desc=\"Borrowing the title but little else from Max Brand’s novel, Marshall offers a comically subversive western with striking views on gun violence and the place of women in the genre, perhaps courtesy of one-time communist Gertrude Purcell sharing script duty. Dietrich plays a chanteuse caught between Brian Donlevy’s ruthless boss and a new sheriff – James Stewart in one of his most shrewdly guileless performances – who proves not quite as acquiescent as he’s supposed to be. Marlene’s memorable barroom fight with Una Merkel caused some consternation in its day.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday March 18\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"A FOREIGN AFFAIR\" info=\"Billy Wilder (1948) 116 mins – PG\" desc=\"Wilder, Richard L. Breen and Charles Brackett’s wicked and pointed satire about a Congressional investigation into GI morals portrays bombed-out Berlin as a supremely corrupt black marketeers’ paradise. Although it stars Jean Arthur as a fish-out-of-water Congresswoman negotiating the moral and cultural quagmire of the emerging Cold War, Dietrich steals the film as a slippery, Mephisto-like chanteuse. A knowing reversal of the star’s renowned anti-fascism, it includes a wonderful score by Frederick Hollaender who also features as Dietrich’s accompanist.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday March 18\" time=\"8:40pm\" title=\"I KISS YOUR HAND, MADAME\" info=\"Robert Land (1929) 66 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"In one of her final silent films, Dietrich stars as a divorcee in Paris luxuriating in her freedom and a circle of adoring men. This divine comedy is marked by elegant set design and the exquisite appeal of Parisian high life, beautifully captured by cinematographers Carl Drews and Gotthardt Wolf. While mostly silent, this was the first German film to use synchronised sound technology, giving a platform to established lead Harry Leidtke and the titular song. However, it is Dietrich who emerges as the clear star, displaying early signs of her extraordinary performative sensuality. 35mm print courtesy of Deutsche Kinematek.\">]>, <Season dates=\"March 23-April 6\" start=\"2020-03-23 18:30:00+11:00\" end=\"2020-04-06 22:46:00+10:00\" title=\"CAST A DARK SHADOW: THE BEAUTIFUL SADNESS OF DIRK BOGARDE\" desc=\"After beginning his theatrical career in London’s West End, Dirk Bogarde (1921-1999) became one of British cinema’s most significant and richly talented actors, his distinguished star persona balancing swooning, matinee-idol good looks with an array of dark, complex, turbulent characters. Bogarde’s proclivity towards multifaceted, sometimes tortured roles can perhaps be traced to the horrors – for example, he was one of the first Allied officers to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after it was “liberated” – he witnessed during World War II, as well as his necessarily closeted homosexuality. With a sensitive, commanding demeanour, and vividly expressive eyes, Bogarde’s screen presence is both subtle and domineering. As his biographer David Huckvale writes: “If Bogarde was starring, the film was simultaneously always about him.” In this regard, it can be said that many of Bogarde’s roles well and truly belong to the actor, while often exploring the complex sexual, political and social identity of his characters. This season includes many of the landmark films of Bogarde’s mature career selected from a wealth of British and European arthouse cinema, profiling his work with six distinguished directors from Liliana Cavani and Luchino Visconti to Rainer Werner Fassbinder. It focuses, in particular, on many of his most notable roles of the 1960s and 1970s, including his indelible performances in Basil Dearden’s Victim and Joseph Losey’s The Servant, and presents a rare screening of his valedictory film, Bertrand Tavernier’s aching Daddy Nostalgie.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Monday March 23\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"THE SERVANT\" info=\"Joseph Losey (1963) 116 mins – M\" desc=\"The first of three collaborations between Losey and celebrated writer Harold Pinter is an uneasy chamber drama involving the privileged Tony (James Fox) and his newly appointed manservant, Hugo (Bogarde in one of his most iconic roles). Adapted from Robin Maugham’s 1948 novel, the film’s power play is permeated with psychological and sexual tension. Winning three BAFTA awards, Losey’s landmark film garnered praise for its candid treatment of class and sexuality as well as Douglas Slocombe’s claustrophobic cinematography.

The sensitive screenplay by the director’s former spouse, Colo Tavernier O’Hagan, may be at least partly autobiographical; the film, like a Chekhov play, allows small details to take on a magnified significance.

The young Wilder developed an obsession with American films while working as a freelance tabloid crime reporter in 1920s Berlin. Following Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, he found himself exiled in Paris where he directed his first film, Mauvaise graine, and from there he moved to Hollywood, where he brought an outsider’s perspective and a journalist’s eye for detail to the dark – and darkly comic – aspects of American life. Over a wildly successful career, Wilder became one of the most versatile filmmakers in Hollywood, switching freely from gritty potboilers and realist noirs to romantic melodramas and comic musicals, all defined by a sophisticated wit and crisp, clever dialogue. Themes of investigation and deception abound in his work, but he rejected genre clichés in favour of morally complicated characters and stories that deeply probed the ironies and contradictions of modern life. A lifelong reporter at heart, his restrained directorial style always reflected the primacy of storytelling and the written word to his work. “If the viewer notices direction”, he once remarked, “you have failed”. This season spans the length and breadth of Wilder’s formidable directorial career featuring key but rarely screened works including the delightful farce The Major and the Minor, the bracingly cynical Ace in the Hole, and the irreverent and autumnal, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Monday April 13\" time=\"6:30pm\" title=\"MAUVAIS GRAINE\" info=\"Billy Wilder and Alexander Esway (1934) 77 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"Collaborating in Paris with a group of exiles, including composer Franz Waxman and screenwriters H.

He was a successful theatre director in Weimar Germany before transferring his passion and critical eye to the silver screen, moving from Nazi Germany to the United States in the late 1930s before working across a range of studios and independent production companies before finding a home at Universal under the supervision of producer Ross Hunter. Sirk brought to his work a strong sense of drama, form and mise en scène, creating films famous for their stylistic excesses, precisely detailed décor and loaded texts and subtexts. Celebrated by the feminist and Marxist critics of the 1970s such as Laura Mulvey and the late great Thomas Elsaesser, and championed by queer directors like Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Pedro Almodóvar and Todd Haynes, his subversive command of the various forms of melodrama and other genres remains celebrated today. The seething worlds of Sirk’s creations are strangely fascinating, endlessly entertaining and provide extraordinary portraits of particular societies, character types and moments in time. This season explores the various facets and stages in Sirk’s screen career, from his early, compromised works in the Nazi-controlled German cinema of the mid-1930s to his occupation as sojourner filmmaker elsewhere in Europe, and from his exploration of a wide variety of genres and modes of production to the extraordinary group of films upon which his contemporary reputation rests (All That Heaven Allows, A Time to Love and a Time to Die and Imitation of Life).\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday May 6\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"IMITATION OF LIFE\" info=\"Douglas Sirk (1959) 125 mins – PG\" desc=\"One of the great films about maternal sacrifice and race, Sirk’s swansong is celebrated as a sumptuous Hollywood melodrama nonpareil, as well as a characteristically searing critique of US materialism.

Entering the industry in the 1970s, Armstrong was more than just an important part of the Australian cinema revival – with My Brilliant Career in 1979 she was the first woman to direct a major feature film in Australia for over four decades, going on to contribute significantly to the national landscape with some of its most impressive, brilliantly modern films. Spread across the realms of commercial and independent cinema, fiction and documentary, Armstrong’s films exercise a consistently sensitive sympathy with women and issues that affect them. It is this emotional and feminist trajectory, continued throughout her career, that reflects the importance of her own role as filmmaker. However, with work that spans a number of genres, it is not only Armstrong’s thematic insight that should be celebrated, but also her outstanding aesthetic skills as a director – she has a sharp sense of story, design, acting, music and rhythm.

Weerasethakul’s approach to cinema is one of bold but cool synthesis, the effect of which is often bizarre and unsettling, particularly for mainstream audiences infatuated with easy notions of realism and narrative “wholeness”. Weerasethakul’s breakout film, Mysterious Object at Noon – a documentary inspired by the surrealist game of the “exquisite corpse” – aptly sets the stage for the director’s daring yet casually synthetic approach to filmmaking. A multidisciplinary artist who also works in the gallery, Weerasethakul’s cinema is notable for its attempts to transcend the boundaries between the corporeal and ethereal, the spiritual and political, the epic and the mundane, the living and the dead. Weerasethakul’s films frequently feature states of sleep, reverie, haunting and unconsciousness, meandering between languid, earthy scenes of candid naturalism and basic tenderness and moments of quiet spectacle invoking the oneiric and supernatural. There is nothing “out of the ordinary” when a ghost or god wanders into frame – in Weerasethakul’s cinema such incidents are as mundane as eating or walking or sleeping. It would nevertheless also be a mistake to see Weerasethakul’s somnambulistic style as merely “personal”: his films openly and even brazenly tackle urgent political questions concerning Thai militarism and the nation’s internal and border conflicts.

The warmth and lightness of his work has always been highly praised but, as Alexander Jacoby notes, he shares with Jean Renoir the double-edged nature of such plaudits: “Those few critics who have written about Shimizu’s work tend to make him sound less interesting than he is.” Chris Fujiwara notes several key recurrent elements in the director’s work, including: a resistance to plotting; anarchy and unpredictability; “the expressive possibilities of camera movement”; and the subversion of the couple. Shimizu’s world is one where the actions of the individual character defines them. He is also often overtly condemnatory of restrictive social structures and institutional norms. His films repeatedly focus on those excluded from mainstream society – “fallen women”, itinerant workers, those with disabilities or children. But, despite his concern with serious subject matter, Shimizu always retained an open approach to filmmaking. David Bordwell describes how he wrote only vague screenplays, making up new dialogue as required, and “rarely budged from his chair on set, even when the camera was moving”. This season of rarely screened 35mm prints, focusing on films from the golden period of 1930s Japanese cinema, reveals a filmmaker of generosity and casual precision. Working with a roster of Shochiku’s finest contracted actors, including Kinuyo Tanaka, Shin Saburi and Chishu Ryu, Shimizu created a body of work that deserves to be regarded as among the best cinema of its era.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday July 15\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"ORNAMENTAL HAIRPIN\" info=\"Hiroshi Shimizu (1941) 70 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"Ozu regular Chishu Ryu plays a soldier who stabs his foot on a hairpin at a rural spa before finding hesitant romance with its owner (the legendary Kinuyo Tanaka). Shimizu’s poignant, ineffably light romance includes a generous ensemble of spa residents watching on, willing the lead couple to overcome their reticence. Not well-received by a highly imperialist country about to enter World War II, when militaristic propaganda was the literal order of the day, Shimizu’s understated humanism, elegant tracking shots and playful optimism marked a very particular kind of rebellion. 35mm print courtesy of the National Film Archive of Japan.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday July 15\" time=\"8:20pm\" title=\"THE MASSEURS AND THE LADY\" info=\"Hiroshi Shimizu (1938) 66 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"Two wisecracking blind masseurs, a mysterious woman on the run, a travelling salesman and his nephew are brought together by happenstance at a remote mountain resort in Shimizu’s disarmingly funny film.

Exploring the porous boundaries between fairy-tale, memory, dream, everyday life, death, masculine, feminine and queer sexuality, Cocteau’s pioneering lyrical and avant-garde work spanned many fields including writing, poetry, painting, design, criticism, acting and directing. He was a polymath who regarded beauty as the ultimate goal to which all of his work should strive. Mixing personal with classical mythology, while openly exploring his own homosexuality, he “set Greek tragedy to the rhythm of our times”. Born to a prominent family in a small town outside Paris, he became associated with writers such as Proust, Apollinaire and Gide when in his early 20s. His integration into the fervent artistic social scene in Paris in the 1910s and 1920s, led Cocteau to complete a varied slate of work, such as a ballet with designs by Picasso and music by Satie (Parade in 1917), and to undertake many creative collaborations with artists such as his lover, actor Jean Marais, Jean-Pierre Melville, Stravinsky, Colette and many others. Despite his work across many forms and mediums, Cocteau’s major artistic contribution was to the cinema. Directing his first film at age of 40, Le sang d’un poète, Cocteau approached the movie screen as “the true mirror reflecting the flesh and blood of [his] dreams”. This season celebrates Cocteau’s truly singular body of work, incorporating all of his key films including his extraordinary collaboration with Melville (Les enfants terribles), his gorgeous adaptation of La belle et la bête, and his hugely influential “Orphic trilogy”.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday September 2\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"ORPHÉE\" info=\"Jean Cocteau (1950) 95 mins – PG\" desc=\"This intensely personal reworking of the Orpheus legend is probably Cocteau’s most influential cinematic achievement.

Her personal and experimental films sought to inspire social change and make largely invisible bodies, images and histories seen. After coming out as lesbian in the 1970s, Hammer took off on a motorcycle with a Super 8 camera and created the groundbreaking Dyketactics, one of the first films to show uncompromising lesbian sexuality. Hammer proceeded to experiment with a variety of avant-garde media and multi-modal styles to deconstruct heteronormative cinema and create unique works on a variety of topics that are unapologetically honest, undeniably political and beautifully life-affirming. As So Mayer claims, “Hammer defined lesbian cinema almost single-handed…. Her generosity of spirit, intellect and embodiment lives on in the films she made that changed the landscape not only of cinema, but of our queer lives and histories.” This tribute includes a broad range of Hammer’s eclectic shorts and features from across her career dealing with diverse themes including the lesbian experience (Dyketactics, Superdyke, Women I Love), lesbian histories (Nitrate Kisses, The Female Closet, History Lessons, Audience), menstruation (Menses), concepts of time and space (Bent Time, Maya Deren’s Sink), endangered species and artistic forms (Endangered), and ageing and death (A Horse is Not a Metaphor, Vital Signs).\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday September 23\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"NITRATE KISSES\" info=\"Barbara Hammer (1992) 67 mins – R 18 +\" desc=\"Hammer’s first feature recontextualises material from the 1933 landmark queer film Lot in Sodom within an optically manipulated fretwork of associative montage also appropriating excerpts from 1930s German fiction films and of three couples making love.

His similarly exuberant contemporary Elo Havetta said: “Jakubisko was the first to show that folklore is something more than songs and dances – a living tradition.” Moreover, his ludic, carnivalesque cinema – a clear influence on latter-day FAMU alumni, Emir Kusturica – is also steeped in magic realism, symbolism and intertextuality and has habitually been highly engaged with the often-precarious times in which it was made.

Abbas Kiarostami (1940-2016) began making films at the start of the 1970s for the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults in Tehran after working in graphic design, book illustration and TV commercials. From his very first short films and features such as The Experience and The Traveller he developed a highly identifiable style and set of philosophical and materialist concerns focusing on the relationship between art and everyday life, the importance of education and pedagogy to the foundations of culture and society, the invisible barrier between documentary and fiction, and the world beyond the frame. Working consistently throughout the 1970s and 1980s on either side of the Islamic Revolution, his films came to international prominence with the unfolding release of the quietly phenomenal “Koker trilogy” – Where is the Friend’s House?, And Life Goes On, Through the Olive Trees – an extraordinary run of movies focusing on a small rural community recovering from the effects of a devastating earthquake, each “internalising” the fictional and documentary worlds of its predecessor.

Two subgeneric traditions comprise the extraordinary corpus that entailed, inevitably granted culinary-inspired monikers linked to the country of production – “borscht” westerns from the Soviet Union, “sauerkraut” from East Germany, “goulash” from Hungary. “Osterns” transposed western generic topoi upon lands Sovietised at the time of production, often setting their action during the Russian Revolution or amid the opening of new Eastern European frontiers in the wake of either World War, while “red westerns” utilised local environments as stand-ins for the American west, situating their action in America but subjecting it to revisionist ideological agendas, or even satire. Combined, osterns and red westerns stand in fascinating dialogue not only with classical Hollywood westerns and their revisionist variations, but also with those films produced in parallel with them in Western Europe, such as the Italian spaghetti western, which they rival in aesthetic and thematic innovation. This season of wholly imported prints offers a grand primer in the Eastern western, offering six key features spanning the gamut of the genre, boosted by three Lemonade Joe-inspired animated shorts which further testify to the Cold War-era East’s paradoxical affinity for all things western.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday November 11\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"AT HOME AMONG STRANGERS\" info=\"Nikita Mikhalkov (1974) 93 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"This legendary, action-packed, Brezhnev-era ostern, set just after the Russian Civil War, represents Mikhalkov’s bravura feature-film directorial debut; he also enjoys a starring role. Pavel Lebeshev’s cinematography alternates colour sequences with black and white, while Eduard Artemyev’s Morricone-inspired score bestows a spaghetti western flavour upon the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid-styled proceedings – except here the anti-heroes are, of course, card-carrying communists. 35mm print courtesy of Gosfilmofond.

Educated in theatre and TV in California, Chahine returned to Egypt to work in publicity for 20th Century-Fox before starting his directorial career as a 23-year-old in 1950. With the fall of the Egyptian monarchy and the rise to power of Arab nationalist Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952, Chahine’s work increasingly fused together popular forms of entertainment with social, cultural and political themes. Chahine was central in launching the career of Omar Sharif, and his reputation was made by the release of the exuberant, bittersweet, neorealist Cairo Station in 1958. His vaunted subsequent reputation rests on a series of pan-Arab, pro-reform and explicitly nationalist films he made in the 1960s such as Saladin and The Land, movies that light on the struggle of peasants and peoples against feudal landlords and foreign invaders, as well as the quartet of autobiographical works he made in the final three decades of his career. Directing over 40 films across six decades, Chahine’s sometimes controversially secular cinema reveals a committed, deeply cinephilic, internationalist, sexually adventurous, explicitly non-fundamentalist and anti-colonial sensibility.\" screenings=[<Screening date=\"Wednesday December 2\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"CAIRO STATION\" info=\"Youssef Chahine (1958) 74 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"The film that established Chahine’s international reputation. This unbridled psychosexual character study – set entirely in and around Cairo’s central train station – was so shocking it was banned in Egypt for two decades. The director stars as a shy, disabled newspaper vendor whose innocent crush on a lemonade seller (Hind Rostom, the “Marilyn Monroe of Arabia”) slowly evolves into a dangerous obsession. Starting as a textured and humanistic examination of a society experiencing tumultuous social change, it transforms into a mixture of florid melodrama and populist tragedy.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday December 2\" time=\"8:25pm\" title=\"THE LAND\" info=\"Youssef Chahine (1969) 130 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"A community of impoverished farmers living on the Nile Delta in the 1930s draw up a petition to stop their exploitation by major landowners and ensure the irrigation of their land. Chahine’s deeply committed and full-blooded agrarian portrait is a potent mix of melodrama, agit-prop and social realism. Widely championed by the Arab left, it is one of Chahine’s most enduring and important films. Adapted from a seminal novel by Abdel Rahman al-Sharqawi published just after Egypt’s 1952 revolution, it gives voice to the defining struggles engulfing the nation.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday December 9\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"ALEXANDRIA… WHY?\" info=\"Youssef Chahine (1979) 133 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"The first film in Chahine’s “Alexandria quartet” follows a young aspiring director enamoured with Hollywood and privately evaluating his current identity and circumstances. Examining Egypt’s political and social tensions, as well as the country’s contradictory relationship to America, Chahine’s partly autobiographical, highly cinephilic fiction combines archival footage with a fantastical vision of World War II-era Egypt. Sparking controversy and government censorship it won the Silver Bear – Special Jury Prize at the Berlinale.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday December 9\" time=\"9:25pm\" title=\"MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE\" info=\"Youssef Chahine (1957) 110 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"Fondly remembered as one of the funniest and most energetic of all Egyptian musicals, this critically overlooked Chahine feature presents the filmmaker at his most brazenly entertaining. A Lubitsch-esque satire about a man and woman forced into a marriage of convenience who gradually fall in love with each other, it marked Chahine’s second and last collaboration with Farid al-Atrash and Shadia, each providing performances that show them at their comic peak. With Hind Rostom.\">, <Screening date=\"Wednesday December 16\" time=\"7:00pm\" title=\"SALADIN\" info=\"Youssef Chahine (1963) 186 mins – Unclassified 15 +\" desc=\"Chahine’s epic depiction of the titular 12th Century Sultan begins with his armies’ conquest of Jerusalem to counter the persecution of Muslim pilgrims. The ensuing Third Crusade pits his forces against invading European Christians led by Richard the Lionheart. Often seen as an allegory of, or tribute to, Egypt’s heroic pan-Arabist President Gamal Abdel Nasser, an angle no doubt accentuated by the filmmakers to secure the co-operation of the Egyptian Government and military in the production of such a hugely expensive, widescreen spectacle. The film is remarkable for the way it captures the fervent, post-colonialist spirit of the times, an Arab world looking to counter then prevalent Hollywood international historical blockbusters with an alternative narrative while emulating their grand, overblown style.\">]>]>"
