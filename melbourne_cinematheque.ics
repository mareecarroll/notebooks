DESCRIPTION:One of the many films De Sica made in collaboration with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini\, this Chaplinesque poetic fairy-tale is “posed midway between reality and fantasy” (De Sica)\, fusing the social and economic concerns of neorealism with a more optimistic and fantastic sensibility. Its central character\, Totò (Francesco Golisano)\, embodies an angelic perception of the world\, passing this onto the impoverished community he belongs to. This “glorious anomaly in De Sica’s career” (Stephen Harvey) is the director’s “most daring” (Michael Atkinson) movie. Courtesy of Cinecittà Luce.

DESCRIPTION:Wilder’s acerbic\, lacerating wit comes to the fore in this masterful social satire about the practices of journalism\, the perils of newsworthiness and the morality of the masses gathering at the scenes of tragic accidents (hence the film’s alternate title\, The Big Carnival). In one of his greatest and most intense performances\, Kirk Douglas plays a cynical newspaper hack who\, for the sake of making front-page national news and resurrecting his career dragooned on a small-town paper\, gambles with a man’s life by forestalling his rescue from a collapsed mineshaft.

DESCRIPTION:Holmes’ opus is one of the most significant films made in Australian before the 1970s revival. A profoundly independent work that robustly demonstrates Holmes’ filmmaking capabilities as well as his qualities as a cinephile and political artist (Henry Lawson and Frank Hardy are both sources)\, it reframes the common theme of “mateship” within explicitly leftist contexts and provides an indelible portrait of Australia from the 1890s to the 1950s. Preceded by Words for Freedom Cecil Holmes (1956) 19 mins – Unclassified 15 +. Holmes’ fugue of Henry Lawson\, union chronicle and folk-tale provides a history of the Australian workers press.

DESCRIPTION:Chahine’s epic depiction of the titular 12th Century Sultan begins with his armies’ conquest of Jerusalem to counter the persecution of Muslim pilgrims. The ensuing Third Crusade pits his forces against invading European Christians led by Richard the Lionheart. Often seen as an allegory of\, or tribute to\, Egypt’s heroic pan-Arabist President Gamal Abdel Nasser\, an angle no doubt accentuated by the filmmakers to secure the co-operation of the Egyptian Government and military in the production of such a hugely expensive\, widescreen spectacle. The film is remarkable for the way it captures the fervent\, post-colonialist spirit of the times\, an Arab world looking to counter then prevalent Hollywood international historical blockbusters with an alternative narrative while emulating their grand\, overblown style.

Dedicated to the memory of the son Sirk left in Germany\, it traces the life of a young soldier (John Gavin) sent to the Russian Front and forced to commit atrocities before meeting a girl while on leave. A sense of encroaching death and ruination grants poignancy to the film’s ill-fated love story and detailed portrait of everyday life in Germany during the war. Beautifully shot in ’scope by key Sirk collaborator Russell Metty\, it features Remarque and Klaus Kinski in supporting roles.

DESCRIPTION:Anchored by Bogarde’s searing performance\, this courageous and groundbreaking “social problem” thriller – the first time the word “homosexual” was spoken in a British film – played a key role in the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Britain. Bogarde stars as a married lawyer who risks his career and marriage to investigate the blackmailing of several closeted gay men – including himself – in socially conservative early 1960s London. Like Bogarde’s character\, the film’s smooth and mannered surface only partially obscures an undercurrent of anger\, paranoia and injustice.

DESCRIPTION:After beginning his theatrical career in London’s West End\, Dirk Bogarde (1921-1999) became one of British cinema’s most significant and richly talented actors\, his distinguished star persona balancing swooning\, matinee-idol good looks with an array of dark\, complex\, turbulent characters. Bogarde’s proclivity towards multifaceted\, sometimes tortured roles can perhaps be traced to the horrors – for example\, he was one of the first Allied officers to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after it was “liberated” – he witnessed during World War II\, as well as his necessarily closeted homosexuality. With a sensitive\, commanding demeanour\, and vividly expressive eyes\, Bogarde’s screen presence is both subtle and domineering. As his biographer David Huckvale writes: “If Bogarde was starring\, the film was simultaneously always about him.” In this regard\, it can be said that many of Bogarde’s roles well and truly belong to the actor\, while often exploring the complex sexual\, political and social identity of his characters. This season includes many of the landmark films of Bogarde’s mature career selected from a wealth of British and European arthouse cinema\, profiling his work with six distinguished directors from Liliana Cavani and Luchino Visconti to Rainer Werner Fassbinder. It focuses\, in particular\, on many of his most notable roles of the 1960s and 1970s\, including his indelible performances in Basil Dearden’s Victim and Joseph Losey’s The Servant\, and presents a rare screening of his valedictory film\, Bertrand Tavernier’s aching Daddy Nostalgie.

DESCRIPTION:The opening night of our 2020 program features recent restorations of key works by two of the towering figures of post-World War II European cinema: Bernardo Bertolucci and Jacques Rivette. Both filmmakers emerged as key figures in the 1960s\, each betraying and confirming their strong affinity with the history of cinema and other art forms. This program profiles two of their less widely seen but central works from this seminal period\, opening with Bertolucci’s appropriately labyrinthine and mercurial adaptation of a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. Released within months of The Conformist\, The Spider’s Stratagem demonstrates both the full range of Bertolucci’s work and his characteristic preoccupation with the legacies of history\, place and identity. The exquisite recent restoration of Rivette’s La religieuse profiles an extraordinary central performance by Anna Karina\, while also highlighting the Melbourne Cinémathèque’s overriding goal of profiling challenging works of film history in optimal conditions.

DESCRIPTION:One of the most audacious and idiosyncratic directors working today\, Apichatpong Weerasethakul (1970-) has crafted a strikingly singular and unnerving cinematic vision of Thai subjectivity and the contemporary world. Weerasethakul’s approach to cinema is one of bold but cool synthesis\, the effect of which is often bizarre and unsettling\, particularly for mainstream audiences infatuated with easy notions of realism and narrative “wholeness”. Weerasethakul’s breakout film\, Mysterious Object at Noon – a documentary inspired by the surrealist game of the “exquisite corpse” – aptly sets the stage for the director’s daring yet casually synthetic approach to filmmaking. A multidisciplinary artist who also works in the gallery\, Weerasethakul’s cinema is notable for its attempts to transcend the boundaries between the corporeal and ethereal\, the spiritual and political\, the epic and the mundane\, the living and the dead. Weerasethakul’s films frequently feature states of sleep\, reverie\, haunting and unconsciousness\, meandering between languid\, earthy scenes of candid naturalism and basic tenderness and moments of quiet spectacle invoking the oneiric and supernatural. There is nothing “out of the ordinary” when a ghost or god wanders into frame – in Weerasethakul’s cinema such incidents are as mundane as eating or walking or sleeping. It would nevertheless also be a mistake to see Weerasethakul’s somnambulistic style as merely “personal”: his films openly and even brazenly tackle urgent political questions concerning Thai militarism and the nation’s internal and border conflicts. This season showcases several of Weerasethakul’s most celebrated works (Tropical Malady\, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives)\, whilst also incorporating his offbeat productions such as The Adventures of Iron Pussy and a sample of his extensive short-film work.

DESCRIPTION:A truly diverse\, influential and mercurial artist\, Jean Cocteau (1889-1963) approached everything he made with the vision of a poet. Exploring the porous boundaries between fairy-tale\, memory\, dream\, everyday life\, death\, masculine\, feminine and queer sexuality\, Cocteau’s pioneering lyrical and avant-garde work spanned many fields including writing\, poetry\, painting\, design\, criticism\, acting and directing. He was a polymath who regarded beauty as the ultimate goal to which all of his work should strive. Mixing personal with classical mythology\, while openly exploring his own homosexuality\, he “set Greek tragedy to the rhythm of our times”. Born to a prominent family in a small town outside Paris\, he became associated with writers such as Proust\, Apollinaire and Gide when in his early 20s. His integration into the fervent artistic social scene in Paris in the 1910s and 1920s\, led Cocteau to complete a varied slate of work\, such as a ballet with designs by Picasso and music by Satie (Parade in 1917)\, and to undertake many creative collaborations with artists such as his lover\, actor Jean Marais\, Jean-Pierre Melville\, Stravinsky\, Colette and many others. Despite his work across many forms and mediums\, Cocteau’s major artistic contribution was to the cinema. Directing his first film at age of 40\, Le sang d’un poète\, Cocteau approached the movie screen as “the true mirror reflecting the flesh and blood of [his] dreams”. This season celebrates Cocteau’s truly singular body of work\, incorporating all of his key films including his extraordinary collaboration with Melville (Les enfants terribles)\, his gorgeous adaptation of La belle et la bête\, and his hugely influential “Orphic trilogy”.

DESCRIPTION:Eight years after the trailblazing My Brilliant Career\, Armstrong and Judy Davis collaborated once more on this emotionally rich multi-generational drama. Davis plays a back-up singer who\, when left stranded in a seaside village on the NSW coast\, re-encounters the daughter she abandoned years earlier. Skirting clear of any hint of cheap sentimentality\, care of Laura Jones’ (An Angel at My Table) penetrating script\, this raw and affective film evocatively expresses the painful reality of fractured relationships. Davis and co-star Jan Adele won AFI Awards. 35mm print courtesy of the National Film and Sound Archive\, Australia. Rights courtesy of Anthony I. Ginnane © 1987 SJL Productions Pty Ltd.

DESCRIPTION:Bogarde plays a Russian Jewish chocolatier in 1930s Germany who plots an escape to Switzerland after becoming convinced that a vagrant (Klaus Löwitsch) is a doppelgänger whose identity he can adopt – though it’s clear to all that what he’s most trying to escape is himself. In response to Tom Stoppard’s adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov’s absurd novel\, a macabre tale laced with melancholy humour\, Fassbinder delivers what The Guardian calls “an icy\, psycho-melodramatic nightmare”\, exploring themes of alienation and mental breakdown in oblique\, playfully provocative ways.

DESCRIPTION:When essayist and critic Phillip Lopate claimed that “we are living in the Age of Kiarostami\, as once we did in the Age of Godard”\, he highlighted both the crucial emergence onto the world stage of Iranian cinema and the specific qualities of Kiarostami’s contemplative\, gently questioning\, porously self-reflexive and overwhelmingly poetic work. Abbas Kiarostami (1940-2016) began making films at the start of the 1970s for the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults in Tehran after working in graphic design\, book illustration and TV commercials. From his very first short films and features such as The Experience and The Traveller he developed a highly identifiable style and set of philosophical and materialist concerns focusing on the relationship between art and everyday life\, the importance of education and pedagogy to the foundations of culture and society\, the invisible barrier between documentary and fiction\, and the world beyond the frame. Working consistently throughout the 1970s and 1980s on either side of the Islamic Revolution\, his films came to international prominence with the unfolding release of the quietly phenomenal “Koker trilogy” – Where is the Friend’s House?\, And Life Goes On\, Through the Olive Trees – an extraordinary run of movies focusing on a small rural community recovering from the effects of a devastating earthquake\, each “internalising” the fictional and documentary worlds of its predecessor. This specially imported season focuses on the films Kiarostami made prior to his Palme d’Or winning opus\, Taste of Cherry\, profiling a range of rarely seen but extraordinary early to mid-career features and documentaries that have only recently been restored\, and providing further evidence of the director’s vaunted reputation as one of the key figures of post-World War II cinema.

DESCRIPTION:Making his directorial debut in 1924 at the age of 21\, Hiroshi Shimizu (1903–1966) went on to make over 160 films in a career contemporaneous with widely acknowledged masters Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi\, in whose critical shadows he often\, undeservedly\, resided. The warmth and lightness of his work has always been highly praised but\, as Alexander Jacoby notes\, he shares with Jean Renoir the double-edged nature of such plaudits: “Those few critics who have written about Shimizu’s work tend to make him sound less interesting than he is.” Chris Fujiwara notes several key recurrent elements in the director’s work\, including: a resistance to plotting\; anarchy and unpredictability\; “the expressive possibilities of camera movement”\; and the subversion of the couple. Shimizu’s world is one where the actions of the individual character defines them. He is also often overtly condemnatory of restrictive social structures and institutional norms. His films repeatedly focus on those excluded from mainstream society – “fallen women”\, itinerant workers\, those with disabilities or children. But\, despite his concern with serious subject matter\, Shimizu always retained an open approach to filmmaking. David Bordwell describes how he wrote only vague screenplays\, making up new dialogue as required\, and “rarely budged from his chair on set\, even when the camera was moving”. This season of rarely screened 35mm prints\, focusing on films from the golden period of 1930s Japanese cinema\, reveals a filmmaker of generosity and casual precision. Working with a roster of Shochiku’s finest contracted actors\, including Kinuyo Tanaka\, Shin Saburi and Chishu Ryu\, Shimizu created a body of work that deserves to be regarded as among the best cinema of its era.

DESCRIPTION:It may come as a surprise to many\, but that most quintessentially American of genres\, the western\, was enormously popular behind the Iron Curtain. Of course it was seldom possible for Eastern Bloc audiences to see films produced in Hollywood. No matter\; even though they deemed the Hollywood western decadent in exemplifying and propagating the United States’ foundational frontier myths\, socialist states took to the production of westerns with great relish. Two subgeneric traditions comprise the extraordinary corpus that entailed\, inevitably granted culinary-inspired monikers linked to the country of production – “borscht” westerns from the Soviet Union\, “sauerkraut” from East Germany\, “goulash” from Hungary. “Osterns” transposed western generic topoi upon lands Sovietised at the time of production\, often setting their action during the Russian Revolution or amid the opening of new Eastern European frontiers in the wake of either World War\, while “red westerns” utilised local environments as stand-ins for the American west\, situating their action in America but subjecting it to revisionist ideological agendas\, or even satire. Combined\, osterns and red westerns stand in fascinating dialogue not only with classical Hollywood westerns and their revisionist variations\, but also with those films produced in parallel with them in Western Europe\, such as the Italian spaghetti western\, which they rival in aesthetic and thematic innovation. This season of wholly imported prints offers a grand primer in the Eastern western\, offering six key features spanning the gamut of the genre\, boosted by three Lemonade Joe-inspired animated shorts which further testify to the Cold War-era East’s paradoxical affinity for all things western.

DESCRIPTION:Over a career spanning 50 years and more than 80 moving-image works\, American filmmaker and visual artist Barbara Hammer (1939-2019) initiated a new kind of cinema made from a distinctively female and lesbian perspective\, challenging the assumptions of mainstream culture and opening a discourse for marginalised groups in society. Her personal and experimental films sought to inspire social change and make largely invisible bodies\, images and histories seen. After coming out as lesbian in the 1970s\, Hammer took off on a motorcycle with a Super 8 camera and created the groundbreaking Dyketactics\, one of the first films to show uncompromising lesbian sexuality. Hammer proceeded to experiment with a variety of avant-garde media and multi-modal styles to deconstruct heteronormative cinema and create unique works on a variety of topics that are unapologetically honest\, undeniably political and beautifully life-affirming. As So Mayer claims\, “Hammer defined lesbian cinema almost single-handed…. Her generosity of spirit\, intellect and embodiment lives on in the films she made that changed the landscape not only of cinema\, but of our queer lives and histories.” This tribute includes a broad range of Hammer’s eclectic shorts and features from across her career dealing with diverse themes including the lesbian experience (Dyketactics\, Superdyke\, Women I Love)\, lesbian histories (Nitrate Kisses\, The Female Closet\, History Lessons\, Audience)\, menstruation (Menses)\, concepts of time and space (Bent Time\, Maya Deren’s Sink)\, endangered species and artistic forms (Endangered)\, and ageing and death (A Horse is Not a Metaphor\, Vital Signs).

DESCRIPTION:Described by Time Out as a “gut wrenching tale of emotional rivalries” and by The Guardian as an “Oedipal farce”\, Cocteau’s claustrophobic adaptation of his own play invites a wide spectrum of responses. Five characters\, two sets\, astonishing close-ups and metronomically precise editing highlight the story of a young man (Jean Marais) who finds himself battling both his parents (Yvonne de Bray and Marcel André)\, each for vastly different reasons\, when he announces that he’s fallen in love. Gabrielle Dorziat and Josette Day round out the ensemble of heightened\, stylised performances. Courtesy of the British Film Institute Archive.

DESCRIPTION:As a trendsetter who pushed the boundaries of conventional gender performance\, and a femme fatale of the silver screen\, Marlene Dietrich’s (1901-1992) sexuality was provocative\, as was the exotic “foreignness” she displayed in her Hollywood films. Beloved for her knack of reinventing herself\, Dietrich was a woman who very consciously managed her career and fastidiously cultivated her image. In 1920s Berlin\, Dietrich acted on the stage and in silent films\, drawing wide appeal for the skills she developed as a chorus girl in vaudeville-style entertainment. Her breakthrough performance as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel in 1930 brought her international acclaim\, a contract with Paramount and a collaborative partner\, Josef von Sternberg\, who would help define her persona across the seven extraordinary features they made together like Dishonored and The Scarlet Empress. Dietrich went on to star in further classic Hollywood films such as Desire\, Angel\, Destry Rides Again and A Foreign Affair for key directors like Borzage\, Lubitsch and Wilder. Although she still made intermittent movies like Wilder’s Witness for the Prosecution\, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer\, harking back (but always renewed) to the early days of her career. As an icon of popular culture\, she remains a powerful signifier in an ever-larger arena of cultural discourses including performativity\, gender\, ageing\, celebrity and sexuality.

DESCRIPTION:Best known as the director of a string of lavish Hollywood melodramas made for Universal Pictures in the 1950s\, Douglas Sirk’s (1897-1987) feature-film career spanned almost 40 films between 1935 and 1959. He was a successful theatre director in Weimar Germany before transferring his passion and critical eye to the silver screen\, moving from Nazi Germany to the United States in the late 1930s before working across a range of studios and independent production companies before finding a home at Universal under the supervision of producer Ross Hunter. Sirk brought to his work a strong sense of drama\, form and mise en scène\, creating films famous for their stylistic excesses\, precisely detailed décor and loaded texts and subtexts. Celebrated by the feminist and Marxist critics of the 1970s such as Laura Mulvey and the late great Thomas Elsaesser\, and championed by queer directors like Rainer Werner Fassbinder\, Pedro Almodóvar and Todd Haynes\, his subversive command of the various forms of melodrama and other genres remains celebrated today. The seething worlds of Sirk’s creations are strangely fascinating\, endlessly entertaining and provide extraordinary portraits of particular societies\, character types and moments in time. This season explores the various facets and stages in Sirk’s screen career\, from his early\, compromised works in the Nazi-controlled German cinema of the mid-1930s to his occupation as sojourner filmmaker elsewhere in Europe\, and from his exploration of a wide variety of genres and modes of production to the extraordinary group of films upon which his contemporary reputation rests (All That Heaven Allows\, A Time to Love and a Time to Die and Imitation of Life).

DESCRIPTION:In a monumental career spanning seven decades\, Billy Wilder (1906­-2002) started out as a central-European émigré who spoke no English and rose to become one of the most widely celebrated writer-directors of Hollywood’s golden age. The young Wilder developed an obsession with American films while working as a freelance tabloid crime reporter in 1920s Berlin. Following Hitler’s rise to power in 1933\, he found himself exiled in Paris where he directed his first film\, Mauvaise graine\, and from there he moved to Hollywood\, where he brought an outsider’s perspective and a journalist’s eye for detail to the dark – and darkly comic – aspects of American life. Over a wildly successful career\, Wilder became one of the most versatile filmmakers in Hollywood\, switching freely from gritty potboilers and realist noirs to romantic melodramas and comic musicals\, all defined by a sophisticated wit and crisp\, clever dialogue. Themes of investigation and deception abound in his work\, but he rejected genre clichés in favour of morally complicated characters and stories that deeply probed the ironies and contradictions of modern life. A lifelong reporter at heart\, his restrained directorial style always reflected the primacy of storytelling and the written word to his work. “If the viewer notices direction”\, he once remarked\, “you have failed”. This season spans the length and breadth of Wilder’s formidable directorial career featuring key but rarely screened works including the delightful farce The Major and the Minor\, the bracingly cynical Ace in the Hole\, and the irreverent and autumnal\, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.

DESCRIPTION:The irrepressible Juraj Jakubisko (1938-) represents the baroque vanguard of the Czechoslovak New Wave’s Slovak contingent. After assisting on early works by fellow students Jaromil Jireš and Věra Chytilová at Prague’s FAMU film school\, Jakubisko soon made his own mark with a succession of acclaimed\, flamboyant and provocative films which saw him dubbed “the Slovak Fellini” at the Venice Film Festival of 1968\, but which also earnt him the sustained wrath of his nation’s censors\, with three of his four 1960s features shelved until after 1989’s Velvet Revolution\, including the extraordinary Birds\, Orphans and Fools that opens this season. His similarly exuberant contemporary Elo Havetta said: “Jakubisko was the first to show that folklore is something more than songs and dances – a living tradition.” Moreover\, his ludic\, carnivalesque cinema – a clear influence on latter-day FAMU alumni\, Emir Kusturica – is also steeped in magic realism\, symbolism and intertextuality and has habitually been highly engaged with the often-precarious times in which it was made. This season of imported prints principally focuses on the director’s key short and feature-length works from the 1960s to the close of the 1980s\, which typically position their lead characters in manic\, triangular relationships amid trying times\, but also includes the sumptuous fairy-tale Perinbaba starring Giulietta Masina\, emphasising Jakubisko’s great affinity with Federico Fellini\, on- and off-screen.

DESCRIPTION:Although born in New Zealand\, Cecil Holmes (1921-1994) is one of the most significant and ambitious filmmakers to work in Australia during the 1950s\, ’60s and ’70s. A dedicated leftist\, his work consistently demonstrated a humanist commitment to the socially disenfranchised\, ranging from the underlying capitalist conditions that force decent citizens into bushranging and stealing to the social and economic conditions confronting Indigenous communities in contemporary Australia (the latter works often made in collaboration with his wife\, anthropologist and activist Sandra Le Brun Holmes). In the 1950s\, Holmes briefly moved from his background in documentary to feature-film production\, but all of his work shares a deep concern for social justice\, place and the precarious fate of displaced and dispossessed peoples in the modern world. Although he is often regarded as a maverick director who struggled to make films Holmes consistently produced challenging work for a variety of governmental\, corporate and philanthropic organisations\, as well as at the behest of such individuals as Australian leftist author\, Frank Hardy.

DESCRIPTION:Born into a multilingual family in cosmopolitan Alexandria\, Egypt\, Youssef Chahine (1926-2008) quickly emerged as one of the key figures of Arab cinema\, a courageous nationalist and humanist whose work ranges across the musical\, melodrama\, comedy\, the historical epic and highly cinematic forms of autobiography. Educated in theatre and TV in California\, Chahine returned to Egypt to work in publicity for 20th Century-Fox before starting his directorial career as a 23-year-old in 1950. With the fall of the Egyptian monarchy and the rise to power of Arab nationalist Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952\, Chahine’s work increasingly fused together popular forms of entertainment with social\, cultural and political themes. Chahine was central in launching the career of Omar Sharif\, and his reputation was made by the release of the exuberant\, bittersweet\, neorealist Cairo Station in 1958. His vaunted subsequent reputation rests on a series of pan-Arab\, pro-reform and explicitly nationalist films he made in the 1960s such as Saladin and The Land\, movies that light on the struggle of peasants and peoples against feudal landlords and foreign invaders\, as well as the quartet of autobiographical works he made in the final three decades of his career. Directing over 40 films across six decades\, Chahine’s sometimes controversially secular cinema reveals a committed\, deeply cinephilic\, internationalist\, sexually adventurous\, explicitly non-fundamentalist and anti-colonial sensibility.

DESCRIPTION:This remarkable\, extremely popular\, late-communist era red western is a rarity for being one of the few entries in the genre directed by a woman. Surikova’s film is also an unusually self-reflexive affair\, and an uproarious comedy\, deconstructing the mythology of the western as it also unravels its own making. Shot in Crimea\, it concerns a zealous cinematographer’s (Andrei Mironov) fin de siècle visit to the fictional Wild West town of Santa Carolina to propagate Paris’ new sensation\, cinema\, and its putative morally uplifting qualities. 35mm print courtesy of Gosfilmofond.

DESCRIPTION:One of Shimizu’s least political works\, tempered by the restricted filmmaking conditions on the cusp of the World War II\, tells the story of a travelling performer (Yaeko Mizutani) who seeks to reinvent herself by moving in with the family of a kindly tea merchant. Demonstrating Shimizu’s extraordinary technical proficiency and relentless innovation\, this minimalist drama touches on social issues during the Meiji Era such as hardships faced by women and class differences\, ending in an ambiguous resolution of the romantic couple. 35mm print courtesy of the National Film Archive of Japan.

DESCRIPTION:Hammer’s first feature recontextualises material from the 1933 landmark queer film Lot in Sodom within an optically manipulated fretwork of associative montage also appropriating excerpts from 1930s German fiction films and of three couples making love. This palimpsest of representations of homosexual life found in the margins and outtakes of cinema history powerfully confronts heteronormative images of sexual and erotic love. Preceded by Endangered Barbara Hammer (1988) 18 mins – Unclassified 15 +. A materialist reflection on the threatened tradition of experimental filmmaking.

DESCRIPTION:Based on the legendary exploits of Mata Hari\, Sternberg’s extravagant reimagining of his native Vienna during World War I is a delirious but grounded mixture of irreverent historicism and romantic melodrama. One of the director’s greatest works\, it features a piercingly nonchalant performance but Dietrich as an alluring sex worker and spy who betrays her country for love. This brilliantly designed and costumed (by Travis Banton) espionage tale provides a lucid portrait of a woman forced to use her sexuality in a hostile patriarchal world. Co-stars Victor McLaglen.

De Sica’s first masterpiece is one of the defining works of neorealism and a fascinating document of a city and country still ravaged by the scars of war. Treading a fine line between stark social criticism and an almost hauntingly poetic symbolism\, James Agee called it “as beautiful\, moving\, and heartening a film as you are ever likely to see”. Written by the great Cesare Zavattini and Sergio Amidei\, amongst others\, it earned an honorary Oscar. 35mm print courtesy of Cinecittà Luce.

Winning three BAFTA awards\, Losey’s landmark film garnered praise for its candid treatment of class and sexuality as well as Douglas Slocombe’s claustrophobic cinematography. With Sarah Miles.

This unbridled psychosexual character study – set entirely in and around Cairo’s central train station – was so shocking it was banned in Egypt for two decades.

Starting as a textured and humanistic examination of a society experiencing tumultuous social change\, it transforms into a mixture of florid melodrama and populist tragedy.

DESCRIPTION:One of Australia’s most successful directors\, Gillian Armstrong (1950-) has built a significant profile as a filmmaker in her home country\, in addition to maintaining a career internationally. Entering the industry in the 1970s\, Armstrong was more than just an important part of the Australian cinema revival – with My Brilliant Career in 1979 she was the first woman to direct a major feature film in Australia for over four decades\, going on to contribute significantly to the national landscape with some of its most impressive\, brilliantly modern films. Spread across the realms of commercial and independent cinema\, fiction and documentary\, Armstrong’s films exercise a consistently sensitive sympathy with women and issues that affect them. It is this emotional and feminist trajectory\, continued throughout her career\, that reflects the importance of her own role as filmmaker. However\, with work that spans a number of genres\, it is not only Armstrong’s thematic insight that should be celebrated\, but also her outstanding aesthetic skills as a director – she has a sharp sense of story\, design\, acting\, music and rhythm. As Felicity Collins writes\, her work “participates fully in the aesthetic force-field of Australian naturalism and arthouse realism”. This season of mostly celluloid prints endeavours to pay tribute to the extraordinary breadth and longevity of Armstrong’s career\, and includes early shorts made while still a student\, famous and underseen features\, and a selection of documentaries.

DESCRIPTION:Vittorio De Sica (1902-1974) will forever be associated with neorealism\, the movement he consolidated with a string of influential masterpieces detailing the hardships of working-class life immediately after the Second World War. Yet the actor and director\, across a career spanning six decades\, ranged widely in his stylistic approaches and concerns. He explored Commedia all’italiana and fabulist fantasy\, and made socially incisive romantic comedies and frothy sex comedies. He also worked in Los Angeles as well as Rome and his late work\, such as the elegiac triumph The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\, successfully combines neorealist principles with Hollywood grandeur and technique. Born in Sora\, near Rome\, De Sica spent his early years in Naples. His bank-clerk father encouraged his entry into acting and by the 1930s De Sica was a matinee idol\, with a debonair screen persona akin to Cary Grant’s. He would continue to act his entire life\, often cheerfully taking on lightweight roles to fund his own films\, while parlaying his acting talent into a directorial empathy with performers both professional and amateur. It was while acting on a film in 1935 that De Sica met screenwriter Cesare Zavattini\, leading to a partnership that defined not only both men’s careers but also the neorealist movement. Of De Sica’s 35 films\, Zavattini worked on the scripts of 26\, a number of which appear in this season. Working with Zavattini\, De Sica would direct four films that would go on to win Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\; in fact\, the pair’s work on Shoeshine and Bicycle Thieves received the honorary awards that inaugurated the category. This season presents many of the key works of De Sica’s landmark directorial career including his defining contributions to neorealism and the peak of his iconic collaborations with Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren\, Marriage Italian Style.

Although it stars Jean Arthur as a fish-out-of-water Congresswoman negotiating the moral and cultural quagmire of the emerging Cold War\, Dietrich steals the film as a slippery\, Mephisto-like chanteuse. A knowing reversal of the star’s renowned anti-fascism\, it includes a wonderful score by Frederick Hollaender who also features as Dietrich’s accompanist.
